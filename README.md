# [Algorithm Visualizer](https://deepanshupal09.github.io/algorithmvisualzer/)
Algorithm Visualizer is a platform where one can simulate certain algorithms.
- In sorting section, each bar represent a positive integer value and we compare two value to sort in ascending order.
- In graph section, each grid cell represents a node in a implicit graph. Each node has 4 adjacent node and the distance being 1 unit between them.

# Algorithms Used
- Sorting Algortihms    
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Heap Sort
